Hquery
======

Uses pure HTML as "template" for rendering views a Hpricot sequence 
(in the .hquery counter-part file) is executed to modify the pure HTML
and the resulting HTML is output to the browser


Layout
======

If your controller is "Hello", and your action is "World", then you will need

  app/views/hello
              |-- world.hquery
              |-- world.html

"world.html" is the vanila HTML file your designers worked on.
"world.hquery" contains the ruby code to manipulate data.


Example .hquery content
=======================

# Given you have an array of Hash results, the following code uses
# Google's results page as-is.

select "li.g[@style='']", @result_list do |ele, result, index|
  # each iterated html element, and its matching iterated data
  ele.html "a.l",         result["title"]
  ele.html "a.l[@href]",  h(result["url"]) 
  
  # or
  ele.attr "h3 a.l", "href", h(result["url"])
end

select "div#ssb p b:last", ["0.00004"] do |ele, seconds|
  ele.html seconds
end
